# NTC-Kit - Linux OS Building For NTC Chip

This repo will be used for the development of a single directory that allows the user to enter a few simple details and generate their own linux kernel build along with a ready to reploy object that they can easily flash to their chip or store for later usage.

## What Is This


- sunxi-tools		 = ~/NTC-Kit/sunxitools		// Holds The Downloaded Or Copied Linux Kernel
- CHIP-linux		  = ~/NTC-Kit/linux			// Holds The Downloaded Or Copied Linux Kernel
- CHIP-tools		  = ~/NTC-Kit/tools			// Holds The CHIP related tools, eg flashers and so on
- CHIP-buildroot	= ~/NTC-Kit/buildroot		// Holds The BuildRoot Program To Compile The Distro
- ............... = ~/NTC-Kit/output			// Folder Used To Store The Built Distro
- ............... = ~/NTC-Kit/ready			// Final Folder - Users Can Find Prepared Files Here
